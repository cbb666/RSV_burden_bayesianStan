# RSV_burden_bayesianStan
We proposed a Bayesian latent-class model framework to explicitly account for heterogeneous laboratory diagnostic data. By simulating datasets under different sample size and testing practice scenarios, we aimed to assess accuracy of the model and identify scenarios where the model could be applied to yield robust estimates of RSV disease burden.
